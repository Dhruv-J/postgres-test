#To use docker with postgres and to run the postgres server,
#the port must be exposed to the outside of the container.
#Use the following command:
docker run -p host_port:container_port --name container_name postgress
#-p means that the following part of the command will give the ports to use
#usually the container default port is used, which is 5432
#--name container_name shows the name of the container
#example:
docker run --rm -p 5432:5432 --name pg postgres

#how to connect pgadmin (can only do while server is running)
docker run --rm --name pgadmin -p 5050:80 -e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL="name@example.com" -e PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD="password" dpage/pgadmin4
#80 is the default port for pgadmin
#PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL and PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD are environmental variables that must be explicitly defined
#dpage/pgadmin is the docker image that is pulled
#the --rm tag allows the user to delete the container upon termination, making it easier to debug
